Hi all,

My name's Wojtek and I own business called 'WOJST Usługi Informatyczne Wojciech Stańczyk' with a website https://wojst.pl 
I write my thoughts, tips and another IT notes on the blog, which can be found at https://wojst.pl/blog

Today (29-04-2023) I've started the #100DaysOfLinux challenge. My goal is to finish all courses I have purchased but haven't yet completed and complete many labs during this time.

So, let's get started :)

## Day 1 (Saturday, 29-04-2023)
### Git
- work with git (create remote repo and push commit) <br />
