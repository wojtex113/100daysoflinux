Hi all,

My name's Wojtek and I own business called 'WOJST Usługi Informatyczne Wojciech Stańczyk' with a website https://wojst.pl<br/>
I write my thoughts, tips and another IT notes on the blog, which can be found at https://wojst.pl/blog

Today (29-04-2023) I've started the #100DaysOfLinux challenge. My goal is to finish all courses I have purchased but haven't yet completed and complete many labs during this time.

I aspire to be a Linux Administrator, which is my main goal, and I'm also considering the possibility of working in Dev/Ops.

Additionaly, I'm a firefighter in Państwowa Straż Pożarna, where we work 24-hour shifts every three days. During my shifts I will try found a few minutes to read or watch something related to this challenge.

So, let's get started :)

## Day 1 (Saturday, 29-04-2023)
### Git

## Day 2 (Sunday, 30-04-2023) [Firefighter duty]
